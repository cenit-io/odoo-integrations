The import.io API is a [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)ful API. It is designed as much as possible to have resource-oriented URLs and to use HTTP status codes to indicate API status.

We use standard HTTP which can be understood by any HTTP client, and we support [CORS](http://enable-cors.org/) to allow you to interact with our API from a client-side web application. Remember, you should never expose your secret API key in any public client-side code.

JSON is always returned from the API, including errors.

import.io uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of an API request. In general, codes in the 2xx range indicate success, codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that resulted from the provided information (e.g. a required parameter was missing), and codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with our servers.

All API requests *should* be made over HTTPS to &#x60;https://api.import.io/&#x60;



## API Authentication

You authenticate to the import.io API by providing your API key as URL query string parameter &#x60;_apikey&#x60;. You can manage your API key from [your account](https://import.io/data/account/). In the My Settings page, the API in not URL encoded. To prevent a Base64 error, make sure to use a URI encode function for your query. You can also get an encoded API Key from the GET API or POST API tab in the application. Your API key allows unrestricted privileges your account, so keep it secret!

When you are logged in, *submit your password in this page header* to see the API key in the API explorer below.

## Quick Start

### Basic concepts

* import.io lets you publish dynamic APIs and Data Sets to its platform (object class &#x60;Connector&#x60;).
  * To disambiguate between dynamic API created on the platform, and static APIs such as this, we use the term &#x60;Connector&#x60; within the import.io APIs to refer to a API or Data Set published to import.io.
  * Extractors, Crawlers and Data Sets are just specializations of Connector.
* You can create these via UI tooling, or by using the APIs detailed here.
* The dynamic API definition for a Connector is versioned (object class &#x60;ConnectorVersion&#x60;); querying a connector by default queries the most recent version, whose id can be found on the &#x60;Connector&#x60; object (&#x60;latestVersionGuid&#x60;).
* Each &#x60;ConnectorVersion&#x60; has a schema (object class &#x60;Schema&#x60;) defining its input and output properties.
* All objects are accessible via the REST API.
* The output properties are returned with the query data.
  * Extra meta-data may be passed back depending on a output property [type](#data-types). 
  * All fields _may_ be multi-valued (i.e. arrays).

## Data Types

For most output property types we also return &#x60;myvar/_source&#x60; with the original textual data.
